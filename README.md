Bitcoin VIP Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

What is Bitcoin VIP?
----------------
BitcoinVIP is derived from Bitcoin (a decentralized digital currency in the form of P2P). It is deeply designed and developed on the basis of Bitcoin, and is committed to providing a safe, fair, green and efficient decentralized solution for the traditional centralized integration system. By using BitcoinVIP, you can bring together neglected centralization points to regain value. In the application layer BitcoinVIP will continue to explore, such as BTCV integration based on IPFS, to achieve a decentralized, secure, traceable P2P e-commerce based on blockchain.
